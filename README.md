# Autonomous Market Analyst: Building AI Agents for Deep Research ðŸ¤–ðŸ“Š

This project demonstrates the creation of an autonomous AI agent crew using the CrewAI framework to perform in-depth market analysis on a given topic. The agents collaborate to research information online, analyze findings, and compile a comprehensive report.

The system utilizes Google's Gemini Pro LLM via the Google Generative AI API, LangChain components, and the DuckDuckGo search tool to gather and process information, simulating a team of research analysts.

**Task:** Perform market analysis on "AI in Healthcare" (or a user-defined topic).
**LLM:** Google Gemini Pro
**Framework:** CrewAI, LangChain
**Tools:** DuckDuckGo Search
**Focus:** Demonstrating multi-agent systems, autonomous task execution, LLM integration for research and analysis, web search automation, and collaborative AI using CrewAI.

## Key Techniques & Concepts Demonstrated

Based on the implementation within the notebook (`19_Autonomous_Market_Analyst_Building_AI_Agents_for_Deep_Research.ipynb`), the following key concepts and techniques are applied:

* **AI Agent Framework (CrewAI):** Utilizing CrewAI to define, configure, and orchestrate multiple specialized AI agents working together.
* **Autonomous Agents:** Creating agents capable of performing complex tasks (research, analysis, writing) with defined goals and tools.
* **Role-Based Agents:** Defining distinct roles for agents (e.g., `Market Research Analyst`, `Technology Analyst`, `Business Analyst`) with specific goals, backstories, and capabilities.
* **Task Delegation:** Defining specific, actionable tasks for each agent (e.g., `research_market_trends`, `analyze_technological_advancements`, `compile_report`).
* **Tool Usage:** Integrating external tools (like `DuckDuckGoSearchRun` via LangChain Tools) to allow agents to access real-time information from the web.
* **LLM Integration:** Using Google Gemini Pro (`ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` via `langchain_google_genai`) as the underlying intelligence driving the agents' reasoning and generation capabilities.
* **Crew Orchestration:** Defining a `Crew` in CrewAI that manages the sequence and collaboration between agents to achieve an overall objective.
* **Process Management:** Setting the process to `sequential` for a step-by-step workflow.
* **API Integration:** Interfacing with the Google Generative AI API.

## Agent Roles & Tasks Defined

The system consists of a crew with specialized agents:

1.  **Market Research Analyst:**
    * **Goal:** Find and report on market trends, key players, and future predictions for the specified topic (AI in Healthcare).
    * **Task (`research_market_trends`):** Conduct web searches using DuckDuckGo to gather relevant market data and news.
2.  **Technology Analyst:**
    * **Goal:** Analyze the technological aspects, innovations, and challenges within the topic.
    * **Task (`analyze_technological_advancements`):** Search for and analyze recent technological breakthroughs, tools, and potential hurdles in AI for Healthcare.
3.  **Business Analyst:**
    * **Goal:** Compile research findings into a structured business report, including market overview, tech analysis, and strategic recommendations.
    * **Task (`compile_report`):** Synthesize the information gathered by the other agents into a final, comprehensive market analysis report.

## Analysis Workflow

The notebook follows these steps to set up and run the AI agent crew:

1.  **Setup & Dependencies:** Installing necessary libraries (`crewai`, `langchain-google-genai`, `python-dotenv`, `duckduckgo-search`, etc.) and importing modules.
2.  **API Key Configuration:** Loading the Google API key from environment variables.
3.  **Tool Initialization:** Setting up the `DuckDuckGoSearchRun` tool.
4.  **LLM Initialization:** Initializing the `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` model (Gemini Pro).
5.  **Agent Definition:** Creating instances of `Agent` for each role (Researcher, Tech Analyst, Business Analyst), defining their `role`, `goal`, `backstory`, `tools`, and assigning the `llm`.
6.  **Task Definition:** Creating instances of `Task` for each step, describing the expected output and assigning the appropriate `agent`. Dependencies between tasks can be set via the `context` parameter (implicitly sequential here).
7.  **Crew Creation:** Assembling the agents and tasks into a `Crew`, specifying the `process` (e.g., `Process.sequential`).
8.  **Execution:** Running the crew's analysis using `crew.kickoff()`.
9.  **Output:** Printing the final report generated by the Business Analyst agent.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Google API Key:** An API key for Google Generative AI is required. Obtain one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2.  **Environment Variable:** Store your Google API key in a `.env` file in the project directory with the key `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

## How to Run the Project

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Jayasurya227/Autonomous-Market-Analyst-Building-AI-Agents-for-Deep-Research.git](https://github.com/Jayasurya227/Autonomous-Market-Analyst-Building-AI-Agents-for-Deep-Research.git)
    cd Autonomous-Market-Analyst-Building-AI-Agents-for-Deep-Research
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    (It is recommended to use a virtual environment)
    ```bash
    pip install crewai crewai_tools langchain langchain_community langchain_google_genai google-generativeai python-dotenv duckduckgo-search jupyter ipykernel ipython
    ```
    *(Note: Specific versions might be required for full compatibility, check any `requirements.txt` if available or adjust as needed.)*
3.  **Set up Prerequisites:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.
4.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook "19_Autonomous_Market_Analyst_Building_AI_Agents_for_Deep_Research.ipynb"
    ```
5.  **Run Cells:** Execute the cells sequentially. The `crew.kickoff()` cell will initiate the agent interactions and may take some time to complete as it involves LLM calls and web searches. The final output will be the market analysis report.
